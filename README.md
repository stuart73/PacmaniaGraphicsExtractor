# Pacmania Graphics Extractor

This Windows forms tool was used to extract the original graphics from the arcade Pacmania Roms for use in my Unity Pacmania game and tutorial.

All of the code to do the extraction can be found in the "Form1.cs" file

If you have the original Pacmania Roms, then compile this app (I used Visual Studio 2022 community) and then select "Load Rom".  Please don't ask me for the Roms.

The arcade version of Pacmania stored the character graphics in 2 roms  (pn_obj-9.bin and pnx_obj1.bin).  You will need to select one of these.
After this you should see something like the screenshot above. 

The graphics are stored, in the Roms, as raw 4 bits per pixel and as 16x16 pixel sprites.  However, most of the game character graphics are 32x32. So, 4 of these sprites are used to make a complete sprite.  The code handles all of this.

The graphics are stored as index (logical) colours and needs a RGB palette assigned to it.  The code has the game palettes stored in it, so you need to select which palette you wish to use from the dropdown combo. Note: some of the graphics are "re-used" in the arcade but use a different palette.

The code could be improved to handle the sprite/palette correct combination for you, but I found this tool was already good enough for what I needed it for.  I simply saved the graphics using the "Save as .bmp" and then used "Gimp" to cut/paste and generate the proper sprite sheets used in the Unity game.

Note.  Other graphics e.g. The background/world graphics, were generated by a series of screenshots (from playing the arcade version in MAME) and then stitched them together in "Gimp".  However, that method was too slow for the characters graphics, hence for the need of this tool.
